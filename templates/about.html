    <b>What we do:</b><br>
    This service enables you to integrate your charging needs with the fluctuations in the wholesale power market, in order to
    reduce carbon emissions and support the integration of renewable energy sources like solar and wind.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The problem:</b><br>
    Every day, grid operators work to keep the electrical system in balance, matching what is generated with what customers are using.
    When a cloud comes overhead, decreasing generation, or when people get home from work and crank up the air conditioner, operators
    scramble to bring more generation online to meet the demand. However, the quickest resources to respond might not be the cleanest.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The solution:</b><br>
    As electric vehicles become more mainstream, we have a growing flexible resource to smooth out the demand on the energy system.
    By enrolling in this service, you can elect to temporarily pause charging when there is strain on the electrical grid.
    We look at a combination of wholesale energy prices and the carbon intensity of electricity generation in your area to determine
    when it makes the most sense to delay chargin. Often, the best value is found by pausing charging for as little as 5 minutes.
    We know you need the range in your car, so we will never stop stop your car from charging if it is less than halfway charged,
    and we will make sure we don't delay charging for more than 1 hour in any day. You can also control how frequently we interrupt
    your charging to make sure you always have the power you need. Also, we have a trip mode so you can let us know when you want 
    full control of your charging while on a long trip.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How you benefit:</b><br>
    In return for your help in managing the grid, we will show you how many pounds of carbon dioxide you saved from being emitted.
    You already have a clean electric vehicle. Help us unlock the full potential it has to help our planet. As an added perk, we will
    be adding more features to help you log key performance data on your vehicle, and remotely schedule and control security and 
    convenience features like sentry mode and climate.
